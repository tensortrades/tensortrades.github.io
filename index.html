            <p>
              <a href="https://tensortrades.github.io/">Tensor Trade</a> is an open
              source Python framework for building, training, evaluating, and
              deploying robust trading algorithms using reinforcement learning.
              The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible,
              to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a
              single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution
              of HPC machines.
            </p>

            <p>
              Under the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing
              machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines
              and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to
              enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies,
              by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by
            </p>

            <p>
              Every piece of the framework is split up into re-usable
              components, allowing you to take advantage of the general use
              components built by the community, while keeping your proprietary
              features private. The aim is to simplify the process of testing
              and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement
              learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable
              strategies.
            </p>

            <h2>Tensor Trade: Shaping the Future of Global Commerce</h2>
            <p>
              In the rapidly evolving landscape of international trade, Tensor
              Trade has emerged as a groundbreaking force, revolutionizing the
              way businesses engage in commerce and disrupting traditional
              paradigms. This transformative concept is built upon cutting-edge
              technologies and innovative economic models, introducing a new era
              of efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity to the global
              marketplace.
            </p>

            <h2>Decentralized Trading Platforms</h2>
            <p>
              Tensor Trade pioneers the introduction of decentralized trading
              platforms, harnessing the power of blockchain technology to create
              secure, transparent, and direct transactions between buyers and
              sellers. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, streamlining
              the trading process and significantly reducing costs associated
              with cross-border transactions.
            </p>

            <strong>Smart Contracts and Automation</strong>

            <p>
              At the heart of Tensor Trade is the integration of smart
              contracts, enabling the automation of trade agreements. These
              self-executing contracts, encoded with predefined rules and
              conditions, ensure that transactions occur seamlessly and
              trustlessly. The automation not only enhances operational
              efficiency but also minimizes the risk of fraud, offering a level
              of security previously unseen in traditional trade.

            <ul>
              <li>
                If you put 10 NFTs into the protocol (let's say you set up a 10%
                delta)
              </li>
              <li>and the price 10x's from here</li>
              <li>
                you would have been better off holding the NFTs than providing
                liquidity because your order will have sold the NFTs gradually
                at prices lower than 10x

            </ul>

            <h3>Tensor Trade Protocol Risk</h3>
            <p>
              Putting anything into any protocol is risky because it can get
              hacked and drained. There's no shortage of precedents in crypto
              history.
            </p>
            <h4>The good news for you is:</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                ‚úÖ There have been FAR fewer (literally by a magnitude) hacks on
                Solana vs Eth. This is because Solana's programming model is
                more complex but ultimately safer.
              </li>

              <li>
                ‚úÖ At this point we're keeping the protocol closed source to
                reduce the attack surface, while we do the necessary security
                checks.
              </li>

              <li>
                ‚úÖ We're the same team that wrote Gem Farm by Gemworks - a
                staking protocol that has been open-sourced from day 1 and
                that's used for staking by over 60% of NFT projects on Solana.
                Gem Farm has never been hacked or drained for ~12m since it's
                been released.
              </li>

              <li>
                ‚úÖ We're actively using auditing software like Sec3 and are
                engaging with auditors to get our protocol to the point where
                we're comfortable open-sourcing it.
              </li>
            </ul>
